## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or later
- Git
- Make (optional but recommended)
- golangci-lint for code quality
- gofmt for code formatting
- go mod for dependency management

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gotunnel.git
cd gotunnel

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/johncferguson/gotunnel.git

# Install dependencies
go mod download
go mod tidy

# Install development tools
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest

# Build the project
go build ./cmd/gotunnel

# Run tests
go test ./...
```

### IDE Setup

We recommend using VS Code or GoLand with the following extensions:
- Go language support
- EditorConfig support
- Git integration
- Markdown preview

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

Follow these principles based on our development rules:

#### Security (Severity: Error)
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for databases
- Implement proper error handling without exposing stack traces
- Follow the principle of least privilege

#### Code Simplicity (Severity: Warning)
- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Keep functions small (10-30 lines typically)
- Maximum nesting depth of 3 levels
- Use clear, descriptive naming
- Follow SOLID principles and DRY

#### Testing Requirements
- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Test both happy and error paths
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run with race detection
go test -race ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/tunnel -v

# Generate coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Writing Tests

- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use meaningful test names that describe what's being tested
- Mock external dependencies
- Clean up resources in test teardown

Example test structure:

```go
func TestTunnelCreation(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        config  TunnelConfig
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {
            name:    "valid configuration",
            config:  TunnelConfig{Port: 3000, Domain: "test"},
            wantErr: false,
        },
        // Add more test cases
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update documentation** for user-facing changes
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Run the test suite** locally
4. **Run linters** and fix any issues:
   ```bash
   golangci-lint run
   go fmt ./...
   go vet ./...
   ```
5. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes (in Unreleased section)

### PR Guidelines

1. **Create a descriptive title** that summarizes the change
2. **Reference any related issues** using GitHub keywords (fixes #123)
3. **Describe your changes** in detail in the PR description
4. **Include screenshots** for UI changes
5. **Check all CI checks pass**
6. **Respond to review feedback** promptly

### Review Process

- PRs require at least one maintainer approval
- All CI checks must pass
- No merge conflicts
- Code coverage should not decrease significantly
- Changes must follow our style guide

## Style Guide

### Go Code Style

We follow standard Go conventions with these additions:

```go
// Package comments should be present
package tunnel

// Exported types need documentation
type Manager struct {
    // Fields should be documented if not obvious
    tunnels map[string]*Tunnel
}

// Method documentation should explain what it does
// and any important side effects or requirements
func (m *Manager) CreateTunnel(config Config) (*Tunnel, error) {
    // Early returns for validation
    if err := config.Validate(); err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid config: %w", err)
    }
    
    // Group related logic
    tunnel := &Tunnel{
        ID:     generateID(),
        Config: config,
    }
    
    // Clear error handling
    if err := tunnel.Start(); err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to start tunnel: %w", err)
    }
    
    return tunnel, nil
}
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep README focused on users
- Put detailed technical docs in /docs
- Update documentation with code changes

## Commit Messages

We use conventional commits for clear history:

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Test additions or corrections
- `build`: Build system or dependency changes
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

### Examples

```
feat(tunnel): add support for custom headers

- Allow users to specify custom HTTP headers
- Headers are validated before being applied
- Added tests for header validation

Closes #123
```

```
fix(cert): resolve certificate expiry detection

The certificate expiry check was using the wrong timezone,
causing false positives. This fix ensures UTC is used
consistently.

Fixes #456
```
