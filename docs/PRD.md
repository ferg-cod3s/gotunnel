# Product Requirements Document (PRD): gotunnel

## Executive Summary

**gotunnel** is a secure local development tunneling tool that creates HTTPS-enabled local domains with automatic certificate management and network discovery. It enables developers to access local services via custom `.local` domains with zero-configuration HTTPS and network-wide accessibility.

## Product Vision

**"Make local development as secure and accessible as production, with zero configuration complexity."**

## Core Value Proposition

- **Zero-Config HTTPS**: Automatic certificate generation and installation
- **Network Discovery**: Accessible across local network via mDNS
- **Developer Experience**: Simple CLI with intuitive commands
- **Security First**: Proper certificate management and privilege handling
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Full-Stack Developers**: Testing frontend/backend integration locally
- **Mobile Developers**: Testing apps against local APIs with HTTPS
- **DevOps Engineers**: Local environment replication and testing

### Secondary Users
- **QA Engineers**: Cross-device testing on local network
- **Design Teams**: Sharing work-in-progress across devices
- **Students/Bootcamps**: Learning HTTPS and networking concepts

## Core Features & Requirements

### 1. Tunnel Management (MVP)
**User Story**: *As a developer, I want to create secure tunnels to my local services so I can test them with HTTPS and share across devices.*

#### Functional Requirements:
- **Create Tunnel**: `gotunnel start --domain myapp --port 8080`
  - Automatically appends `.local` suffix if not provided
  - Supports both HTTP and HTTPS upstream services
  - Binds to standard ports (80/443) with privilege escalation
- **List Tunnels**: `gotunnel list` shows active tunnels with status
- **Stop Tunnel**: `gotunnel stop myapp.local` terminates specific tunnel
- **Stop All**: `gotunnel stop-all` terminates all active tunnels

#### Technical Requirements:
- HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy with configurable upstream
- Graceful shutdown with cleanup (hosts file, certificates, DNS)
- Concurrent tunnel support (multiple domains simultaneously)
- Port conflict detection and clear error messaging

### 2. Certificate Management (MVP)
**User Story**: *As a developer, I want automatic HTTPS certificates so I can test my apps with real SSL without manual certificate creation.*

#### Functional Requirements:
- **Auto-Certificate Generation**: Creates valid certificates for `.local` domains
- **CA Installation**: Installs local CA in system trust store
- **Certificate Rotation**: Handles expiring certificates automatically
- **Certificate Cleanup**: Removes certificates when tunnels are destroyed

#### Technical Requirements:
- Integration with `mkcert` for certificate generation
- Platform-specific certificate installation (macOS Keychain, Windows Certificate Store, Linux CA store)
- Certificate validation and expiry monitoring
- Secure certificate storage with proper permissions

### 3. Network Discovery (MVP)
**User Story**: *As a developer, I want to access my tunnels from other devices on my network so I can test mobile apps and cross-device functionality.*

#### Functional Requirements:
- **mDNS Registration**: Registers `.local` domains for network discovery
- **Cross-Device Access**: Other devices can resolve and access tunnels
- **Service Discovery**: Lists available tunnels on network
- **Automatic IP Resolution**: Handles local IP changes

#### Technical Requirements:
- mDNS service registration and advertisement
- DNS server for local resolution
- Network interface detection and adaptation
- Service health monitoring

### 4. System Integration (MVP)
**User Story**: *As a developer, I want tunnels to work transparently with my local development workflow without complex configuration.*

#### Functional Requirements:
- **Hosts File Management**: Automatic `/etc/hosts` entries for local resolution
- **Privilege Management**: Secure elevation for system modifications
- **Process Management**: Background operation with system integration
- **State Persistence**: Tunnel state survives application restarts

#### Technical Requirements:
- Safe hosts file modification with backup/restore
- Cross-platform privilege escalation (sudo, UAC)
- Process lifecycle management and cleanup
- YAML-based state persistence in user directory

### 7. Advanced Networking
- **Custom Headers**: Inject headers into proxied requests
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple upstream targets per domain
- **WebSocket Support**: Full-duplex communication support
- **Request/Response Modification**: Transform requests in transit

### 8. Developer Experience
- **Shell Integration**: Bash/Zsh completion and shortcuts
- **IDE Integration**: VS Code extension and plugins
- **Hot Reloading**: Auto-restart tunnels on configuration changes
- **Rich CLI Output**: Progress bars, colors, and formatted output

## Non-Functional Requirements
